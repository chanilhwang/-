How to interact
	1. open Project1/Project1.sln
	2. if you right click on DataRace.cpp, you can find out 'analysis' on solution explorer
	3. click Run Code analysis on File.
	4. you can see visual studio find out the bug before excute this file.

What I learned from creating the demo
	Lots of people have troubles with using thread. We can easily find the bug with analysis.
	"Before excuting it"

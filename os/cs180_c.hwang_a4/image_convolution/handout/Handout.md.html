# CS180 Image Convolution - Threads Assignment

## Information
For this assignment you will be optimizing an image processing program.
This Image Convolution program, given one or more PNG files, will generate seven new versions, where each applies a different effect.

![Identity](images/conv_bell.Identity.png)![Blur](images/conv_bell.Blur.png)![Sharpen](images/conv_bell.Sharpen.png)
![Emboss](images/conv_bell.Emboss.png)![Lighten](images/conv_bell.Lighten.png)
![Darken](images/conv_bell.Darken.png)![EdgeDetect](images/conv_bell.EdgeDetect.png)


## Programming Tasks

Your goal is to optimize the provided program by utilizing threads and processes.

1. Run each specified image in it's own process.
	- You must make a cross platform interface that is used by your application logic
	- Then seperate the OS specific system calls into their own cpp files

2. Run each effect on it's own thread. 

3. Split up an effect's calculation over multiple threads

### Non-programming Tasks

For small images, you shouldn't see a big performance gain. In fact, using threads may make it slower.

However, for very large images you should see a performance gain.

In order to get the best efficiency for both small and large images, you should find a threshold. One that decides if an image is small enough then you'll use a single threaded loop otherwise use a divided multi-threaded loop.

1. Describe what you picked for your threshold and how you got it.

2. Describe how you determine how many threads to create.
	- You may want to checkout [std::thread::hardware_concurrency](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread/hardware_concurrency)

3. Your executable must be faster or match the original non-threaded version.
	- Show a report of measurements comparing the original version with yours
	- How does it compare with the following scenerios?
		* single small image
		* single medium image
		* single large image
		* multiple small images
		* multiple medium images
		* multiple large images
	- You should include your CPU information that you used to run the tests
		* on windows: `wmic cpu get caption, deviceid, name, numberofcores, maxclockspeed, status`
		* on ubuntu: `cat /proc/cpuinfo`

4. The project should support building and running on Windows using VS2017 15.8.2 and Ubuntu using g++ 8.2.

## Timing

You can time the program in bash with the `time` command

* `time ./image_convolution file1.png file2.png`
	- Real time is defined as time measured from some fixed point (e.g., the start) in the life of a process (elapsed time).
	- User CPU time is the time spent executing code in user mode. 
	- System CPU time is the time spent by the kernel executing in system mode on behalf of the process (e.g., executing system calls).

Powershell has it's own command for timing as well

* `Measure-Command {start-process image_convolution.exe -argumentlist "file1.png file2.png" -Wait}`

## What to submit

Submit all the code and project files needed to build and run on Windows and Ubuntu.

Do not submit auto generated files and do not submit images.

## Recommendations

Try using **`std::async()`** first.

Try using **`std::packaged_task`** second.

Use **`std::thread`** and **`std::mutex`** last.
